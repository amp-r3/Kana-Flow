# Backend

The backend is a Hono application running as Cloudflare Pages Functions on the `nekotype` Pages project, with a D1 database; sign-in is Google and GitHub only, via the Arctic library. One finished test costs 4–5 written D1 rows; a sync that carries only learning progress costs 1–2.

## Free-tier limits that constrain the design

**Row budget per finished test:** result row 1 + automatic primary-key index entry 1 (a `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` creates one) + `results_user_time` index entry 1 + `user_stats` 1 + `user_settings` 0–1 = 4–5 rows. The authoritative figure is `meta.rows_written` returned by D1; the acceptance limit is 6. At 6 rows the daily write limit allows about 16,000 tests.

**Row budget per learning sync:** `user_stats` 1 + `user_settings` 0–1 = 1–2 rows. A learning session adds no row of its own, and the sessions between two syncs travel in one batch.

## D1 schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT, display_name TEXT, avatar_url TEXT, created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE oauth_accounts (
  provider TEXT NOT NULL, provider_user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY (provider, provider_user_id)
);
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  json TEXT NOT NULL, updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
-- typing statistics, counters, learning state, typing records and last applied seq per device in one row
CREATE TABLE user_stats (
  user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  kana_stats TEXT NOT NULL, counters TEXT NOT NULL, learn TEXT NOT NULL,
  typing_records TEXT NOT NULL, device_seq TEXT NOT NULL, last_sync_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
CREATE TABLE results (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ended_at INTEGER NOT NULL, content TEXT NOT NULL, script TEXT NOT NULL, strictness TEXT NOT NULL,
  config TEXT NOT NULL, kpm REAL NOT NULL, kana_accuracy REAL NOT NULL, json TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX results_user_time ON results(user_id, ended_at DESC);
CREATE TABLE content_reports (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT, item_id TEXT NOT NULL, content_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT NOT NULL, comment TEXT, created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

`user_stats.device_seq` maps `deviceId` → last applied `seq` (see [Batches](storage-sync.md#batches)). The `user_stats` row is created with the user in the OAuth callback, so a sync always finds it.

`user_stats.learn` holds the learning state ([Metrics](metrics.md#data-model)). For a learner with both tracks fully unlocked after a year of daily sessions it is about 200 KB, mostly the last 10 recall answers of 229 kana and 365 days of answer-time buckets per track: well below the 2 MB row limit. The CPU cost of merging such a row is part of the P5 acceptance.

### Request and response bodies

`Settings`, `TestResult`, `KanaStat`, `Counters`, `TypingRecords`, `Track`, `RecallAnswer`, `LearnEntry`, `LearnStat` and `LearnState` are defined in [Metrics](metrics.md) and [Storage and sync](storage-sync.md). These types live in `shared/types`; the matching valibot schemas live in `shared/schemas`.

```ts
type LearnDelta = {
  entries: Record<KanaKey, LearnEntry>; // changed entries
  unlocked: Record<Track, KanaKey[]>; // newly unlocked kana
  recent: Record<KanaKey, RecallAnswer[]>; // new recall answers, at most 10 per kana
  stats: Record<KanaKey, LearnStat>; // increments
  activeDays: [first: number, last: number][]; // runs of days that became active
  recallBuckets: Record<Track, Record<string, Record<string, number>>>; // increments
};
type SyncDelta = {
  kanaStats: Record<KanaKey, KanaStat>; // increments
  counters: Counters; // increments
  learn: LearnDelta;
  settings: Settings | null; // null when unchanged
};
type SyncRequest = {
  v: 1; // batch format version
  deviceId: string;
  seq: number;
  delta: SyncDelta;
  results: TestResult[];
};
type Snapshot = {
  settings: Settings | null;
  kanaStats: Record<KanaKey, KanaStat>;
  counters: Counters;
  learn: LearnState;
  typingRecords: TypingRecords;
};
type SyncResponse = { lastSeq: number; snapshot: Snapshot }; // POST and GET /api/sync
type ResultsResponse = { results: TestResult[]; next: string | null }; // next: cursor for `before`
type MeResponse = {
  id: string;
  email: string | null;
  displayName: string | null;
  avatarUrl: string | null;
};
type ReportRequest = {
  itemId: string;
  contentVersion: string;
  reason: 'wrong_reading' | 'wrong_translation' | 'other';
  comment?: string; // at most 500 characters
  turnstileToken: string;
};
```

`POST /api/reports` and `DELETE /api/me` return `204`.

### Errors

Every error body is `{ "error": { "code": string, "lastSeq"?: number } }`.

| Status | `code`             | When                                                    |

| 503    | `unavailable`      | D1 failed or is over its limit                          |

### Applying a batch

Two devices of one user can sync at the same moment, and the update of `user_stats` is a read-modify-write of one JSON row. [`batch()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/d1-database/) makes the write atomic but does not protect the earlier read, so writes use optimistic concurrency on `user_stats.version`:

1. Read `user_stats`, including `version`, and apply the `seq` rules.
2. Compute the merged statistics, counters, learning state, typing records and `device_seq` by the rules in [Storage and sync](storage-sync.md#merge-rules).
3. Run `batch()` with `UPDATE user_stats SET … , version = version + 1 WHERE user_id = ? AND version = ?`, `INSERT OR IGNORE` for each result, and the `user_settings` upsert if settings changed.
4. If the `UPDATE` reports `meta.changes` = 0, another request won: repeat from step 1 once. If it loses again, return `503 conflict`; the client keeps its batch and resends it.

A batch that lost still inserts its results, because `batch()` runs every statement. This is harmless: inserts are idempotent by `id`, and typing records are computed from every result of the batch, not only newly inserted ones. A lost attempt spends extra rows, so the row budget above applies to the uncontended case.

## Authentication and security

- **Session:** a random 32-byte token in cookie `nt_session` (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`); D1 stores only its SHA-256 hash. Lifetime 30 days, renewed when less than 15 days remain.
- **CSRF:** `SameSite=Lax` plus an `Origin` header check on every POST and DELETE.
- **Accounts from different providers** are linked by verified email (Google `email_verified`, GitHub primary verified address). Without a verified email a separate account is created.
- **Sync request limits:** body at most 256 KB, at most 200 results per batch, at most one request per 5 s per user (checked against `last_sync_at`, no extra writes). Input is validated with valibot schemas from `shared`.
- **Report abuse:** per-request caps above, plus a Cloudflare Turnstile token verified server-side on every request to `/api/reports`. WAF rate-limiting rules are not used: they require an own DNS zone, and \*.pages.dev is not one. The Turnstile script loads only when the report dialog opens, outside the initial budget.
- Client-submitted results are accepted without server-side verification in the MVP; there are no leaderboards.
- OAuth secrets are stored as Pages project secrets; schema changes are applied via `wrangler d1 migrations`.
- **Local development:** `wrangler pages dev` with a local D1; Vite proxies `/api` to it.

* **Environments:** production binds the production D1. Pages preview deployments bind a separate preview D1 and hide sign-in. OAuth clients:
  - Google: one OAuth client with two registered redirect URIs, for `nekotype.pages.dev` and for `localhost`. Google does not accept wildcard redirect URIs, so preview subdomains cannot sign in.
  - GitHub: two OAuth Apps, because an OAuth App has one callback URL: one for `nekotype.pages.dev` (production secrets) and one for `localhost` (development secrets in `.dev.vars`).
  - Turnstile uses separate site keys per environment.
